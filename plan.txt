Platform: Progressive Web App (PWA)
Development Environment: VSCode on Windows
Target Device: Android (Xiaomi 10T Pro)

📊 Current Status
✅ Project Setup (Completed)
The project has been successfully initialized using React and Vite.
Tailwind CSS is fully installed, configured, and integrated.
PWA functionality is active and the app is installable.

✅ Dashboard & UI (Completed)
The main UI component is built, mobile-first, and matches the design.
All known issues have been resolved.
A consistent bottom navigation bar has been implemented across the Dashboard and Planner pages.

✅ Feature: Task Management (Completed)
Task View: The dashboard renders a dynamic list of tasks.
Task Interaction: Users can toggle task completion status.
Task Count: The header dynamically shows the number of incomplete tasks.
Task Creation: New tasks can be created via a dedicated page with a form.
- FAB Menu: The floating action button now opens a menu to create a new Task, Goal, or Habit.

Category Management:

✅ Planner Page (Completed)
A new planner page has been created, displaying tasks with their descriptions in a timeline view.

✅ State Management Refactor (Completed)
The application's state management for tasks and categories has been refactored to use React Context API. This improves modularity, reduces prop drilling, and enhances scalability for future features.

🎯 Next Steps
- Implement state management for Goals and Habits using React Context.
- Establish relationships and linking mechanisms between Tasks, Goals, and Habits.
- Develop UI components for Goals and Habits sections.
- Plan future features (e.g., calendar view, habit tracking logic).
- Refine UI/UX based on user feedback.
